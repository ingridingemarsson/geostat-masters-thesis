This repository contains the code produced for the Master's Thesis work Retrieving precipitation over Brazil - A Quantile Regression Neural Networks approach at the department of Space, Earth and Environment, Chalmers University of Technology in 2021. The code for downloading a dataset utilizes the [pansat](https://github.com/SEE-GEO/pansat) library, and the code for modelling the [quantnn](https://github.com/simonpf/quantnn) library. Published thesis can be found at ... soon.
